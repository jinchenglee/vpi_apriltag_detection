# vpi_apriltag_detection
Demo code to use NVidia VPI API to detect april tag. 

The code follows the VPI samples from [Vision Programming Interface](https://docs.nvidia.com/vpi/samples.html). The testing platform is Jetson Orin NX 16GB on Seeed Studio J401 carrier board. Please be noticed, Jetson Orin Nano has no PVA built-in, you will only be using the CPU backend not PVA (progarmmable vision accelerator).
